## Intro

This is a breakout board for low pin count SMD components : 0402 0603 0805 1206 SOT23 SOT223 SOT323.

Before that when you wanted to breadboard some SMD components it was a bit tricky :

Now you can use those tiny pretty easy to solder adapters :

## Example uses

See some [sample usages](https://hackaday.io/project/10412-hacker-breakout-board-for-most-popular-smd#menu-details)

## Motivation

This breakout board is usefull to prototype with SMD components by allowing to plug those in a breadboard - or any matching 0.1" spaced pins, like some arduino family boards for instance.

It is derived from the [Awesome PCB project](https://hackaday.io/project/10412-hacker-breakout-board-for-most-popular-smd) by Simon.

My motivation for redesigning it from scratch was to :
*   Learn Kicad.
*   Allow people to order those boards for themselves, as Simon did not "yet" release his files.
*   Also allow branching, new features and improvements from the already nice original idea.

## Documentation

Not much yet, some pictures in the Doc subfolder.
You can probably use some informations in the [pdf from awesomepcb](http://www.awesomepcb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/0603_0805_1206_SOT23_SOT223_0402_SOT323_rev01_documentation-PCB.pdf) although that board is somewhat different.
